# Bachelor's Thesis - Creating an AI Bot for StarCraft 2
## Description
This project is part of the Bachelor's Thesis (TFG) in Computer Engineering - Software Engineering. The objective is to develop a bot for the game StarCraft 2 using artificial intelligence. To achieve this, we have used tools such as Visual Studio Code, Python 3.9, and the python-sc2 library.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Visual Studio Code**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for writing and debugging code.
- **Python 3.9**: Programming language used to develop the bot.
- **python-sc2**: An API for creating bots and scripts for StarCraft 2 using Python.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following components installed:
- **Python 3.9**
- **StarCraft 2**
- **The python-sc2 API**

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/beallasai/botStarcraft.git
cd botStarcraft
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the bot, use the following command:
```
python python3 bot_script.py
```
Make sure the *bot_script.py* file is the name of one of the given bots in the project with the settings you want to test.

## Run your favourite bot and check how it reacts in battle against different enemies and difficulties!
